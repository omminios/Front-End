                    This is the cloud resume that you are reading right now. I have created this
                    page with the intention of anyone being able to see my credentials as long
                    as they have internet access. I decided to keep it simple with using the technologies above.
                    I have a passion for cloud technology and wanted to utilize it in my first project to learn more about it.
                    I used AWS technology such as S3, Cloudfront, Route 53, Lambda, Cloud Formation and API Gateway, and Dynamo DB to create this page 
                    with a counter for each person who visits my site. I also use Infrastructure as code (YAML)
                    to create a blueprint for this page to automatically deploy me resources to the cloud.
                    this page is updated anytime i push my code to github after passing some 
                    linting for my front end and backend by utilizing github actions 
                    I created this as my first page and i wanted to see if it would land me a job.

                <p>
                    This is the 2nd project that i have created, This is a word per minute game 
                    that i created to test out my skills with JavaScript. I thought that it would be fun
                    to build since i was still new to development and wanted to try messing around more
                    with the POST method using an API. This project uses the AWS platform similarly to my
                    Cloud resume. I used S3, Cloudfront, Route 53, API Gateway, and Dynamodb. I also used a third party API
                    to get the words to populate the words that appear on the screen. 
                    I made this project with the intention of learning and getting ready for my 
                    projects that i was getting ready to work on next.

                        This is a cloud site that i made in college with some classmates for a class project.
                        it was a cloud development class and it is the project that i had the most fun with
                        due to collaboration, using newer technologies and the constant grind to meet deadlines.
                        It was my idea to host the site using AWS and we used some new technologies. Some of these
                        technologies include AWS Amplify, Dynamodb, etc. I decided to use React since we were thinking of
                        the longevity of this project if we wanted to expand our project and reuse components.
                        we also used tailwind to keep the blinders on us so that our themes stayed within a scope, allowing us
                        to stick to a theme. I was responsible for the infrastructure and frontend portion of this project.
                        and used a few different react libraries to help with the styling and convinience for the user.
