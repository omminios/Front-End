<h3> About Me </h3>
<p> Hello readers My name is Noah and I am partaking in the Cloud Resume Challenge <a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/instructions/">To learn more about the challenge click here</a>. I have been studying Information Technology since i graduated highschool
although I was not sure exactly what field I wanted to get into. I was able to get a IT helpdesk job which help me understand the fundamentals but i knew that i wanted to learn more.
 I later discovered the cloud and was intrigued by the freedom and creativity that could be expressed in the cloud.
I began to get curious and that drove me to get my AWS Solutions Architect Associate. I am now working on more projects so that i can score real world experience and even have some fun with it. </p>
